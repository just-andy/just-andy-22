## In a nutshell

The horse racing racecard. For anyone who's not a fan of racing, it's hard to underestimate its importance to the betting experience, whether offline at a meet or, here, online. It brings the runners and riders to life for punters - and it's worth over Â£1 billion in turnover for William Hill racing.

Every horse racing site features a racecard though. So our challenge was to make the William Hill racecard a key differentiator - a one-stop-shop for users to explore and validate their choices, make it easy to place bets while being able to use independent data for relevance (unlike other sites).

### Project Goals:

- Be the first racing product to provide independent data from two sources; Racing Post and Timeform. This should increase bets placed per active based on previous data and analysis.
- Fix a number of legacy issues on alternate markets; forecast/tricast, match bets etc. This will increase turnover on these markets.
- We have seen that streamed events on all sports increases turnover, therefore, the signposting and labelling for streaming events should be clearly labelled.
- Integrate multiple promotions and concessions for the user to opt-in to or be made aware.

### Round 1 - The Lab

This project actually started with a mobile prototype because we had a slot in our user testing lab coming up. In a change to our normal design process, we started with building our best guess. Because of the complexity of the prototype, I built out a functional racecard in HTML/CSS using the [Foundation for Sites](https://foundation.zurb.com/) framework.

The Product Owner had a strong view on how things should work, a clone of
Racing Post, so I built out Prototype and tried out the more traditional view
in an alternative prototype.

## Testing Outcomes

I organised and moderated the two-day session in our London office with
candidates that met our criteria. Acting as the moderator I was able to see
first hand how they interacted with the product.

_Results:_ Prototype 2 was the unanimous outcome as users found it more familiar. The product owner took this on board for the next stages along with the other feedback.

  I would use this for all my racing betting if you tidied it up, there is a bit
  too much data
