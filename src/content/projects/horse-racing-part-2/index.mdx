## In a nutshell

The horse racing racecard. For anyone who's not a fan of racing, it's hard to underestimate its importance to the betting experience, whether offline at a meet or, here, online. It brings the runners and riders to life for punters - and it's worth over Â£1 billion in turnover for William Hill racing.

Every horse racing site features a racecard though. So our challenge was to make the William Hill racecard a key differentiator - a one-stop-shop for users to explore and validate their choices, make it easy to place bets while being able to use independent data for relevance (unlike other sites).

### Project Goals:

- Be the first racing product to provide independent data from two sources; Racing Post and Timeform. This should increase bets placed per active based on previous data and analysis.
- Fix a number of legacy issues on alternate markets; forecast/tricast, match bets etc. This will increase turnover on these markets.
- We have seen that streamed events on all sports increases turnover, therefore, the signposting and labelling for streaming events should be clearly labelled.
- Integrate multiple promotions and concessions for the user to opt-in to or be made aware.
