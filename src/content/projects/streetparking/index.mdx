## Practice what you preach

I love working out, years of sitting at a screen have taken their toll on my posture and I learned to compensate this with functional fitness and strength training. Eighteen months ago I joined the Street Parking programme and community. The community has an extremely vibrant community and I shared a redesign of a similar fitness app.

A few months ago, their owners reached out as they needed a UX/UI designer to join their engineering team that were creating an MVP of their platform.This was a passion project to be involved in, I was given the opportunity to design and resolve a lot of the issue myself and other community members were facing.
