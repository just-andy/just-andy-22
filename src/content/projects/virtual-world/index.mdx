Virtual Sports is surprisingly one of the largest visited parts of a Sportsbook, filling that void in betting for customers that don't want to burn through their balance on slots or table games.

At William Hill our Virtual World section, containing virtual racing and football products, was receiving a high volume of traffic, but unfortunately had been left to linger without analysis, optimisation or love for a couple of years.

My task as the UX designer and Sportsbook UX lead was to work with the Product Owner, business stakeholders and development team to deliver a new product before the 2018 World Cup.

The key performance indicator (KPI) target for this revamp was to **increase turnover by 25%**. Although the virtual product had been poorly supported, and pretty much left untouched since the first MVP launch, it was still generating a large amount of income. As mentioned previously, sports customers that didn't want to venture into casino products would prefer to play virtual sports between games or in dead spots in the sports calendar.

## Starting With Data

A quick analysis of betting behaviour showed that there was a steep decline in users placing more than a single bet. Unfortunately, our tracking didn't allow us to dig deeper to identify if this was due to the platform performance or customer behaviour.

To reach the business goal it was clear that we had to decrease the friction for users to place multiple selections per page visit.
